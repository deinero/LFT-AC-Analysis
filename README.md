# LFT-AC-Analysis
https://lookingfortokens.com/

This analaysis explores the measures taken by LFT in order to protect themselves against cheaters.
The attempts in general are pretty bad, and this reversal took me 40 minutes while i was waiting on something, with more time and this guide anyone can easily bypass / emulate any techniques that they use.
It is pretty clear as well that the developer of this anti cheat is very inexperienced, as he does not know how to obfuscate code properly, and can't actually create any half functional anti-tamper measures as well.
This analysis was only done statically, using IDA freeware 8.2
