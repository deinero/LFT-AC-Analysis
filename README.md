# LFT-AC-Analysis
https://lookingfortokens.com/

This is a static analysis of the new anti cheat that has recently been created by Looking For Tokens (LFT). \n
This will go through some of their useless anti - tamper measurements, and their attempts at making a heuristic based anti cheat. \n
This reversal was only done using Scylla and IDA 8.2 Freeware. \n
